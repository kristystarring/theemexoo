                            <p> I have a few questions. 1) If you showed Terminator 2 in a movie theatre in 1920, what would the reaction be. 2) What would be the worst modern movie to show in 1920 3) What sort of movie would it have to be to have the exact same reaction in 2015 as showing T2 would be in 1920. Just an odd fun question really. I picked 1920 at random since picture houses where growing in popularity but still primitive. I've just completed reading the draft of Fate of Cthulhu.

It looks great. However, I've hit one snag: To government agencies, the party will be indistinguishable from a gang of international.

YOU CAN FIND THE CHANGES (AND REASONING) HERE (https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3hbiio/update_1001_greatest_movies_of_all_time_plus/) So over the past few months I have been carefully creating a system using the most popular movie rating systems available online, as well as general movie data, to determine the greatest movies of all time. I started off by gathering ratings from IMDB (User/. 
I started keeping track of what I watched in theaters when I was 10 years old in 2003 but those were on scraps of paper and now lost. I have a digital record up to the start of 2008. I have a log of every film I saw since the start of 2010 but all my 2000s data is lost. I'll share my complete 2010s stuff in 2 years when the decade wraps up (I've watched roughly 2.5k films, though I'm not sure how many different films, probably 2k).

The Mummy doesn't need fixing, it needs a complete rewirte. My intention is to making the film more closer to the claustrophobic horror root of the 30s original, instead of a poor man's Mission Impossible. Dark Universe should have more similar to Conjuring Universe instead of Marvel or DCEU because their IPs are monster horrors, not superheroes. Less budget but more coherent horror story. This is hypothetical rewrite combines the elements of the 30s film, the Hammer film, and the Brandon Frase. </p>
